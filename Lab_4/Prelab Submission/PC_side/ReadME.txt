MSP430 Microcontroller Communication Program
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains a main.py file that enables communication with an MSP430 microcontroller.
The program allows users to establish a connection with the microcontroller and send/receive data to and from it.


Features
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Serial Communication: The program utilizes a serial communication protocol to establish a connection with the MSP430 microcontroller.
It enables reliable data transfer between the microcontroller and the host computer.

Two-Way Data Transfer: Users can send data from the host computer to the microcontroller and vice versa.
This enables bi-directional communication and allows for control and monitoring of the microcontroller's operation.

Configurable Settings: The program provides configurable settings for baud rate, parity, stop bits, and other parameters to ensure compatibility with different MSP430 microcontroller configurations. Users can easily modify these settings based on their specific requirements.


Requirements
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To use this program, you will need:

MSP430 microcontroller
Host computer running a compatible operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS)
Appropriate serial communication hardware (e.g., USB-to-serial converter)
Development environment or IDE compatible with the MSP430 microcontroller (e.g., Code Composer Studio, Energia)

Usage
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Connect the MSP430 microcontroller to the host computer using the appropriate serial communication hardware.

2. Open the program in your chosen development environment or IDE.

3. Configure the communication settings according to your MSP430 microcontroller specifications. Ensure that the baud rate, parity, stop bits, and other parameters match the microcontroller's configuration.

4. Compile and upload the program to the MSP430 microcontroller.

5. Run the program on the host computer.

6. Follow the instructions displayed by the program to establish a connection with the microcontroller (type '7' for menu!!!)

7. Once the connection is established, you can send and receive data between the host computer and the microcontroller.
